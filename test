Today Elimination Round One starts for 1,000 Students of Saylani Batch 4:
During the next 15 days the following four sections will take part in two Git tests:
Mohammed Tuaha Ahmed Section
Rehan Uddin Section
Zeeshan Hanif Section
Inam Ul Haq Section
The pass percentage is 60%. The students will have to pass at least one Git test to go to the second elimination round. All those who fail both the Git tests will be removed from the program. All those who score above 90% in any one of theses two tests will given a treat in the best restaurant in Karachi i.e. Kolachi Restaurant with the four teachers/mentors. 
In total there will be Seven Elimination Rounds in the Saylani Web/Hybrid Mobile Program:

1. Round One: Git
Total No. of Tests: 2
Passing Requirement: 1

2. Round Two: HTML 5 and CSS
Total No. of Tests: 3
Passing Requirement: 2

3. Round Three: JavaScript
Total No. of Tests: 6
Passing Requirement: 4

4. Round Four: TypeScript
Total No. of Tests: 2
Passing Requirement: 2

5. Round Five: Node.js and NoSQL Databases (MongoDB)
Total No. of Tests: 3
Passing Requirement: 2

6. Round Six: Angular 2, Reactive Programming (RxJS), Real-Time Databases (Firebase), Ionic 2 and Cordova (iPhone & Android)
Total No. of Tests: 7
Passing Requirements: 5

7. Round Seven: Design Patterns, Data Structures and Algorithm
Total No. of Test: 3
Passing Requirements: 2

Our estimation is that after first round only 50% of the students will left in the program. This means after round one only 500 students will continue into round two. Hopefully in the subsequent rounds more students will be able to survive. However, even if there is no students left in the program there will be no compromise on the quality because we are searching for 313 students and developers who will build a new Pakistan, Insha Allah.

Note: After each round new students will be given admissions so that the total number of students in the program remains the same. Therefore, after round one it is expected that 500 new students will be given admissions during April in Saylani Batch 4.1
